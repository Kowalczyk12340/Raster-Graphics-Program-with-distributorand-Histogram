Raster-Graphics-Program-with-distributor-and-Histogram
Raster-Graphics Program with distributor and Histogram for my studies created in Java when I can edit the photo on the right side of project with the left side. I can modify with model RGB, Model YUV, Negation, Range of Brightness and creating a histograms which a diagram consisting of rectangles whose area is proportional to the frequency of a variable and whose width is equal to the class interval.
If you want to see this project you have to add to project and structure in InteliJ IDEA 2 jars file.
jcommon-0.9.7.jar
jfreechart-0.9.21.jar
without this jar file the program will be unworking.
The program contains menu with interesting options to choose and modifying the photos on the different ways.
This application allow us create a histogram and distributor and distributor of Y.
All of the work is connected with Raster Grpahics on my study.
